# Go-Julia

This is a [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) calculator implemented in go.  
Not much to it in this early implementation, configuration for example is currently done in code.

An upside to this over my old Processing based implementation is that it's far faster. (~1 second to generate a 600 depth image vs ~10 seconds.)
